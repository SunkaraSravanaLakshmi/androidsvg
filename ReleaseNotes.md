## 1.2.1 (1 February 2014) ##

Apologies to everyone for taking so long to release these fixes.

You can [download the new release at Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/paullebeau/androidsvg/downloads).  If you are a maven user, the release is now available from the central repository.

  * Made parsing of path definitions more robust
  * Fixed a bug with `<line>` elements that used percentage coordinates.
  * Fixed parsing of paths with commas between coordinate sets ([Issue 13](https://code.google.com/p/androidsvg/issues/detail?id=13)).
  * Fixed bad rendering of markers with no viewBox attribute ([Issue 14](https://code.google.com/p/androidsvg/issues/detail?id=14)).
  * Transparently support zipped SVG files (.svgz) ([Issue 15](https://code.google.com/p/androidsvg/issues/detail?id=15)).
  * Added an `SVG.getFromResource()` variant that takes a `Resource` instead of `Context` ([Issue 16](https://code.google.com/p/androidsvg/issues/detail?id=16)).
  * Several improvements to `SVGImageView` ([Issue 20](https://code.google.com/p/androidsvg/issues/detail?id=20), [Issue 21](https://code.google.com/p/androidsvg/issues/detail?id=21) and [Issue 22](https://code.google.com/p/androidsvg/issues/detail?id=22)).
  * Fixed bug with the positioning of nested `<svg>` elements when they don't have a viewBox.
  * Made `SVG.getVersion()` a static method so it can be called without having to load an SVG.
  * Added `setSVG()` method to `SVGImageView`.
  * Allow numbers (floats) in `rgb()` colour components.

## 1.2.0 (16 July 2013) ##

  * This version has some significant API changes.
    * The `SVG.renderToX()` and `SVG.renderViewToX()` methods have been simplified.  There are now fewer variants.
    * A number of methods have been added that allow you to read and set the attributes of the root `<svg>` element.  The attributes that can be accessed are `width`, `height`, `preserveAspectRatio` and `viewBox`.  So for example, if you wanted to force an SVG to stretch to fit your canvas, you can do the following:
```
my_svg.setDocumentWidth("100%");
my_svg.setDocumentHeight("100%");
my_svg.setDocumentPreserveAspectRatio(PreserveAspectRatio.STRETCH);
```
  * Added support for the following SVG 1.2 Tiny features.
    * The `<solidColor>` element
    * The `viewport-fill` and `viewport-fill-opacity` style properties.
    * The `vector-effect` property (non-scaling-stroke).
    * The `<switch>` conditional attributes `requiredFormats` and `requiredFonts`.
    * `xml:id`
  * Errors in the way `width` and `height` were handled in the root `<svg>` element have been fixed.  I have also fixed how the `<svg>` viewport is calculated.  This means that some SVGs will render differently (ie correctly) in this version.  In particular I was being overly enthusiastic with my scaling.  Some files that used to scale to fit the viewport, now will not.
  * The DPI value used to convert real world units such as "cm" or "pt" now always defaults to 96. This follows the recommendation of the CSS specification and means that rendering will now better match the way browsers render SVG files.  You can override the DPI setting using the `SVG.setRenderDPI()` method.
  * The `xml:space` attribute is now supported.
  * Switched to using Doclava to generate the Javadocs.
  * Added support for the `preserveAspectRatio` attribute in `<view>` elements.
  * Added a custom View class for displaying SVG images in your layouts.

## 1.1.182 (8 Mar 2013) ##

  * Added CSS support (`<style>` element) meaning that SVG files generated by Corel Draw are now supported.
  * Fixed handling of `<title>` and `<desc>` elements. The parser was not allowing for the fact that the contents of these elements may be spread over multiple lines and may contain other tags. We now extract the entire textual content of the element. Child tags will be stripped but their text content will be included in the returned string.

## 1.0.170 (3 Feb 2013) ##

Initial release.
