# SVG implementation details #

AndroidSVG supports almost all of the graphical features defined in the SVG 1.1 and SVG 1.2 Tiny specifications.  The main missing features are
animation, filters and SVG fonts.  AndroidSVG is intended only as a static renderer, so animation will probably never be added. However filters and embedded fonts may be supported in the future.

A lot of effort has been put into making AndroidSVG's rendering accurate.  For example, AndroidSVG correctly renders the [SVG Acid Test](http://www.codedread.com/acid/acid1.html).

SVG Acid test: _Note that this file has been slightly modified in the following ways:
  1. an external CSS style sheet has been inlined, and
  1. one CSS selector type that is not currently supported was converted to a style attribute._

The modified file is available on the [downloads page](http://code.google.com/p/androidsvg/downloads/list).

## CSS support ##

CSS support via the `<style>` element was added in version 1.1 of AndroidSVG.  Most features of CSS 2.1 are implemented with a few exceptions.

### The `<style>` element ###

The `<style>` element attributes `type` and `media` are supported.

### Selectors ###

Almost all CSS2.1 selectors are supported except for most pseudo and attribute selectors.

  * Simple selectors like `E`, `E F`, `*`, `E.class`, `E#id` all work as expected.
  * The `E > F` and `E + F` combinators are supported.
  * `E:first-child` is supported, but other pseudo selectors are ignored because they don't make sense in the Android context.
  * `E[id="foo"]` and `E[class="foo"]` are supported, but matching on other attributes will not work.
  * Pseudo elements like `:before` and `:after` are not supported.

### "At" rules ###

`@media` is supported, but other rules like `@charset`, `@import` are not.
